## About this project Laravel 11 Webshop with React, Material-UI (MUI), Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion

This project is a modern e-commerce platform built using Laravel 11 as the back-end framework, integrated with a React front-end for seamless user experiences. The design leverages the power of Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling and Material-UI (MUI) for pre-designed components, ensuring a professional and responsive interface.

To enhance interactivity, the webshop incorporates Framer Motion, providing fluid animations and engaging motion effects. The platform supports three distinct authentication levels:

## Admin: 
Full control over products, orders, news,  and user management.
## User: 
Access to personalized features like order history, wish lists and account management.
## Guest:
Limited access for browsing and exploring products without requiring registration.
